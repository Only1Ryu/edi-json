834 - Benefit Enrollment and Maintenance


HIPAA Role in Implementation Guides

The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (P.L.104-191 known as HIPAA) includes provisions for Administrative Simplification, which require the Secretary of Department of Health and Human Services to adopt standards to support the electronic exchange of administrative and financial health care transactions primarily between health care providers and plans. HIPAA directs the Secretary to adopt standards for transactions to enable health information to be exchanged electronically and to adopt specifications for implementing each standard. Detailed Implementation Guides for each standard must be available at the time of the adoption of HIPAA standards so that health plans, providers, clearinghouses, and software vendors can ready their information systems and application software for compliance with the standards. Consistent usage of the standards, including loops, segments, data elements, etc., across all guides is mandatory to support the Secretaryâ€™s commitment to standardization. This Implementation Guide has been developed for use as a HIPAA Implementation Guide for Enrollment and Disenrollment in a Health Plan.  Should the Secretary adopt the X12N 834 Benefit Enrollment and Maintenance transaction as an industry standard, this Implementation Guide describes the consistent industry usage called for by HIPAA. If adopted under HIPAA, the X12N 834 Benefit Enrollment and Maintenance transaction cannot be implemented except as described in this Implementation Guide.
